##Mini Hype Machine Chrome Extension
by Mark Dunphy (@dunphtastic)

This extension for Google Chrome allows you to control hypem.com from any tab/window.

Here's some things you can do:

* Favorite
* Pause/Play
* Skip/Go back
* Read the blog post
* View track/artist information
* Share what you're listening to on Twitter and Facebook
* Search Amazon for the track/album/artist

##This Branch
Is hacked together and works but is ugly. For the fresh code, check the rewrite branch.
